## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

This is a simple library which avoids using real database in my JavaScript teachings.

It is just a stupid wrapper around a array which provides a easy API for listing, adding, getting and removing items.

## <a name="api"></a> API
```
const FakeModel = require('simple-fake-model');

const model = new FakeModel();
```
Implemented features:

* `model.list()` which returns an array with all the items stored.
* `model.insert(id)` which accepts an object and stores it with an `id`. Inserted item is returned.
* `model.getById(id)` which accepts an id and returns the item stored with provided id.
* `model.deleteById(id)` which removes the item with provided id.

All the methods returns the value using an ES6 Promise.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Install using NPM
```
npm install --save simple-fake-model
```

## <a name="npm-tasks"></a> Useful npm tasks

The module has some `npm` scripts which could be useful for developing purpose:
* `npm test` runs the linter, all the tests and gives test coverage statistics
* `npm run test:unit` runs the unit testing. Using `npm run test:unit:watch` will watch for changes
* `npm run test:coverage` show coverage statistics
* `npm run lint` lints the code

I know the library is stupid as hell. It's probably a feature.

If you think something could be done better or simply sucks, bring up a issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/fcanela/simple-fake-model/issues). Don't be shy. I really love feedback and technical discussions.

### <a name="developing"></a> Developing
Pull requests are welcome (and will make me cry in joy) as long as they pass tests for included and old features.

Did I already say that I **love** technical discussions? Feel free to open a issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/fcanela/simple-fake-model/issues) if you have any doubt.
